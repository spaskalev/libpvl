Q: Can callbacks be called repeatedly ?
A: Yes, callbacks can be called repeatedly.

Q: What about partial reads - if changes are coming through the network for example
A: I should look into it :) - same as partial writes ?

The stats callback need a little bit of more work - how to report generic stats ?
- ignore them for now (leak detection, mark count, coalesced)

Set a partial write trigger - to allow for more predictability during network streaming

It would be good to have some sort of logging :)

api changes

 - remove pvl_replay from public interface, provide it via a function pointer
   to initialization code

    this way caller code has more limited api surface - just mark, commit and rollback

    alternatively, introduce a user-type and a ops-type

sizeof variant with a number of marks - for vla/heap allocation ?
